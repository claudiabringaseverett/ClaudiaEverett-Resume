### About me

**I am originally a self-taught developer.** In 2007 I taught myself Java using Eclipse for a project in high school back in Lima, Peru. I reconnected with programming again in 2011 learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C++.
**I prefer being a part of a small team.** I work best on teams and I also enjoy working on my own.
**I prefer face-to-face communication.** I communicate my ideas best via video conference, face-to-face contact rather than over tools like Slack or e-mail.
**I am a visual thinker.** I visualize problems aand solutions so I am always taking notes to make sure I have an idea before I start working on a project.
**I learn by doing.** I wasn't able to get into software development until I had a problem to solve. The knowledge I have today is mostly that which I've gained practicing software development rather than reading or studying about it.


### My motto

> Always do what you say you are going to.

I use this motto to push my goal of becoming a developer. I decied to self teach myself how to code since early age and I knew one day I will pursue this careeer. I am a natural problem-solver, I do not see problems as obstacles, but rather it is a challenge needed to succeed.
